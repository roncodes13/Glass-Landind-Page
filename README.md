# Glass-Landind-Page

Developed a fully responsive and feature-rich landing page for a game website, showcasing skills in front-end development.

The page includes a well-structured navigation bar, user profile integration, and various interactive sections, all designed with HTML and Tailwind CSS. This project demonstrates my ability to create professional, user-friendly web interfaces with attention to detail and modern design practices.
